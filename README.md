# Arduino Urofluximeter

DIY completely functional Urofluximeter. This device measures the flux of urine (or any fluid) that is deposited in a recipient. It uses a load cell to measure the weight of the liquid in real time and a set of digital filters to process the readings. It produces as result a plot of the flux vs time. The device should be calibrated only once and the calibration constant must be in the Arduino code.
